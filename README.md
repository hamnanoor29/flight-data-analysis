# Flight Data Analysis

This project performs data analysis on flight records using Python and the Pandas library.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on the dataset: `Flights_14Jan.csv` (included in this repository). This file contains raw flight details including distances, durations, and schedules.

## Tasks Performed
The Python code extracts and processes the following information from the CSV:
* **Data Loading:** Reading the `Flights_14Jan.csv` using Pandas.
* **Longest Duration (>19 hours):** Identifying the longest flight duration(outliers) in the records.
* **Distance Analysis:** Calculating and filtering flight outliers.
* **Duplicating and Conflicting Flights:** Detects duplicate and conflicting flights to avoid scheduling errors.
* **Fifth Freedom Flights:** Identify Fifth Freedom Flight operations.
## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells.
